# The Impact of Big Data on Society
In these two articles, I will summarize and discuss the impact of big data on society. The first passage claims that big data can be harmful in several ways. The second article, however, listed different reasons that it can help advance society. 

## Article 1 -- How Big Data Are Harming the Society
In the article [Six ways (and counting) that big data systems are harming society](https://theconversation.com/six-ways-and-counting-that-big-data-systems-are-harming-society-88660), the author Beth Daley claims that there are six ways that big data can be harmful to the society, namely: targeting based on vulnerability, misuse of personal information, discrimination, data breaches, political manipulation, and social harm, data and system errors.  

In my opinion, this passage brings up some valid points regarding the side effect of big data that we often ignored. For instance, it is easy for these data to be stolen or misused. Since a lot of data contain personally identifiable information, it can be vulnerable to those involved. 

In fact, several cases have been brought up in the passage that data has been breached and caused bad influence. It is also not news that data can be used to interfere with the election, which can cause a great amount of risk. 

## Article 2 -- How to Use Data Science Properly
In the article [How Data Science Can Be Used for Social Good](https://onlinemasters.ohio.edu/blog/data-science-for-social-good/), the authors state that there are a great number of benefits that big data can bring to the society. In fact, big data can improve our understanding of ourselves and society. We have seen a lot of CEOs and directors come out and claim the positive impact big data brings to the society and potential impact it can make. 

Although it is true that big data has its own side effects, it is noteworthy that the benefits big data can bring to the table outweigh the loss. When used properly, big data can be used to serve the public and do the common good. I believe that there is no sin in big data itself. However, we do have to be more careful about it and use it in a proper way, There should be formal government agencies monitoring the situation and keeping it clean and organized.
